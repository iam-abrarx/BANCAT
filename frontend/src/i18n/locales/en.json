Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, BANCAT intensified its efforts, distributing thousands of food aid packages to hospitals. A historic milestone was reached in 2022 with the founding of Alok Nibash, the country’s first holistic cancer care home. Today, BANCAT has evolved from a grassroots initiative into a nationwide force for advocacy, providing free medical treatment, accommodation, and emotional support to thousands of \"cancer warriors.\"",
